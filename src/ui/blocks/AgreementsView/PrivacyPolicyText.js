      <p>
        To support us in providing, integrating, promoting, and improving the
        Teache Platform, Payment Services, and our affiliates’ services, we may
        share personal information within our corporate family of companies that
        are related by common ownership or control. One notable example is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span>Sharing with Teache, Inc.</span> Even if your country of
          residence is not the United States, your information will be shared
          with Teache, Inc., which provides the technical infrastructure for the
          Teache Platform.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <strong>5. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</strong>
      <strong className="indent">5.1 Analyzing your Communications.</strong>
      <p>
        We may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the Teache
        Platform for reasons outlined in the “How We Use Information We Collect”
        section of this policy, including fraud prevention, risk assessment,
        regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research,
        analytics, enforcing our Terms of Service, and customer support
        purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we scan
        and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other
        sites. In some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to
        debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We use automated methods
        when reasonably possible. Occasionally we may need to manually review
        communications, such as for fraud investigations and customer support,
        or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We
        will not review, scan, or analyze your messaging communications to send
        third-party marketing messages to you and we will not sell reviews or
        analyses of these communications.
      </p>

      <strong className="indent">5.2 Linking Third-Party Accounts.</strong>
      <p>
        You can link your Teache account with certain third-party services such
        as social networks. Your contacts on these third-party services are
        referred to as “Friends.” When you direct the data sharing by creating
        this link:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          some of the information provided to us from linking accounts may be
          published on your public profile,
        </li>
        <li>
          your activities on the Teache Platform may be displayed to your
          Friends on the Teache Platform and/or that third-party service,
        </li>
        <li>
          a link to your public profile on that third-party service may be
          included in your Teache public profile,
        </li>
        <li>
          other Teache users may be able to see any Friends that you may have in
          common with them, or that you are a Friend of their Friend if
          applicable,
        </li>
        <li>
          other Teache users may be able to see any schools, hometowns, or other
          groups you have in common with them as listed on your linked social
          networking service,
        </li>
        <li>
          information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be
          stored, processed, and transmitted for fraud prevention and risk
          assessment purposes, and
        </li>
        <li>
          publication and display of information that you provide to the Teache
          Platform through this linkage are subject to your settings and
          authorizations on the Teache Platform and the third-party service.

        5.3 Third-Party Partners & Integrations.
      </strong>
      <p>
        Parts of Teache may link to third-party services not owned or controlled
        by Teache, such as Google Maps/Earth. Use of these services is subject
        to the privacy policies of those providers. Teache does not own or
        control these third parties and when you interact with them you are
        providing your information to them.

      <strong>6. YOUR RIGHTS</strong>
      <p>
        You can exercise any of the rights described in this section consistent
        with applicable laws and submit requests for data subject rights. Please
        note that we may ask you to verify your identity and request before
        taking further action on your request.
      </p>

      <br />
      <br />
      <strong className="indent">6.1 Managing Your Information.</strong>
      <p>
        You can access and update some of your personal information through your
        Account settings. If you connected your Teache Account to a third-party
        service, such as Facebook or Google, you can change your settings and
        unlink from that service in your Account settings. You are responsible
        for keeping your personal information up to date.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong className="indent">6.2 Data Access and Portability.</strong>
      <p>
        In some jurisdictions, applicable laws may entitle you to request
        certain copies of your personal information or information about how we
        handle your personal information, request copies of personal information
        that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and
        machine-readable format, and/or request that we transmit this
        information to another service provider (where technically feasible).
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong className="indent">6.3 Data Erasure.</strong>
      <p>
        In certain jurisdictions, you can request that your personal information
        be deleted. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal
        information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We may retain your personal information as necessary for our
          legitimate business interests, such as the prevention of money
          laundering, fraud detection and prevention, and the enhancement of
          safety. For example, if we suspend a Teache Account for fraud or
          safety reasons, we may retain information from that Teache Account to
          prevent that Member from opening a new Teache Account in the future.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may retain and use your personal information to the extent
          necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Teache
          and Teache Payments may keep information for tax, legal reporting and
          auditing obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum
          postings) will continue to be publicly visible on Teache, even after
          your Teache Account is canceled. However, attribution of such
          information to you will be removed. Some copies of your information
          (e.g., log records) will remain in our database, but they are
          disassociated from personal identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because we take measures to protect data from accidental or malicious
          loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may
          not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>7. SECURITY</strong>
      <p>
        While no organization can guarantee perfect security, we are
        continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and
        physical security measures to help protect your information against
        unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>8. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time in
        accordance with applicable law. If we do so, we will post the revised
        Privacy Policy and update the “Last Updated” date at the top. In case of
        material changes, we will also provide you with notice of the
        modification by email at least thirty (30) days before the effective
        date. If you disagree with the revised Privacy Policy, you can cancel
        your Account. If you do not cancel your Account before the date the
        revised Privacy Policy becomes effective, your continued access to or
        use of the Teache Platform will be subject to the revised Privacy
        Policy.
